# How to fix society
A non-judgmental, non-partisan journey that combines lore, ideas, and programming concepts to engage with open source communities.

## Ways to contribute (in life, the universe, and everything)
For those looking to contribute to fixing society
https://github.com/jwq10101010/how-to-fix-society/blob/main/guides/how-to-fix-society.md

## Coding resources
For those who need some guidance on their development journey

## Earning a living
For those who don't live in a post-scarcity society
https://github.com/jwq10101010/how-to-fix-society/blob/main/guides/on-earning-a-living.md

## Collaboration Framework (Infrastructure) (Federated wikis + open source auth protocols)
For those looking to establish architecture for facilitating collaboration amongst different individuals/groups
https://github.com/jwq10101010/collaboration-framework

## Project Collaboration Framework (PCF)
The below project specifications section is sourced from:
https://github.com/jwq10101010/project-collaboration-framework

Feel free to tweak the PCF to fit your project (it is designed to be modular and scalable), or use a different method entirely (not all use cases require a formal definition)

The core idea is around the MVP, which is the minimum amount needed to launch a project or reach a goal.

## Project Specifications for the Open Source Community

**Project overseer(s):** @jwq10101010

**Mission statement:** The purpose of this project is to create a collaborative environment.

**Level of experience required:** All Fours welcome!

**Time commitment required:** Varies on level of interest

**Tech stack:**
- Markup language
- Varies across Planet Nine protocols
- Varies across open source projects

**Skills learned:**
- Collaborative storytelling
- Git repository management
- Systems architecture design
- Distributed computing
- Authentication protocols

**MVP:** Create initial how-to-fix-society.md, context.md, and inspiration.md

**Additional details:**
Feel free to do one or more of the following:
- suggest other ways of fixing society in how-to-fix-society.md
- provide other guides and recommendations for knowledge sharing
- create other collaborative stories utilizing GitHub or other platform
- create an open source project and make some friends along the way
- extend the Planet Nine lore
- contribute to the Planet Nine initiative
- collaborate with a wiki community (there is already existing information out there)


**Additional features to implement:**
- [x] Provide additional context
- [x] Organize this repository's files
- [ ] Continue with guides and recommendations
- [ ] Consider translating to other languages

**Additional Fours**:

## Alternative working titles
- The MVP approach to life, the universe, and everything
  (What is the minimum amount of effort required to achieve a goal?)
- Or, for the lore-builders:
  (What is the minimum amount of effort required to achieve singularity?)
- Another alternative title, where my fellow Fours at? Let's collab! We've got a lot of work to do.
- Yet another possibility, Hitchhiker's Guide to (Project) Collaboration or even Hitchhiker's Guide to Managing a Society
- This guide could be broken down into more manageable, derivative guides if needed.

- MVP = Minimum Viable Product
