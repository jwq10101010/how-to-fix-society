**Project ideas**
If you're looking for project ideas, check out this compiled list: <https://github.com/the-programmers-hangout/programming-resources/blob/master/ideas.md>
If you don't like any of the ideas here and you have seriously looked through all of them, start evaluating the apps and websites you use on a daily basis. Find the flaws they have and the things you would change/add and work on your own version. Alternatively, try to come up with an idea that relates to a hobby you have.
