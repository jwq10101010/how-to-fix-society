## In-Person events and opportunities

Feel free to start up your own in-person event if there are none available near you. Below are some example(s) for inspiration:

### Recurse Center

The [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) is a self-directed educational retreat in New York City for people who want to get better at programming, RC is free for everyone. Attending a retreat at RC is a full-time commitment. You can attend for either a full batch (12 weeks) or a half-batch (six weeks). Batches meet Monday through Friday, 11 am to 5 pm ET. RC also exists online, on Zulip and in Virtual RC. Thanks to the generosity of RC's alumni community, RC offers living expense grants of up to $7,000 for all upcoming batches. Since the Recurse Center is free for everyone, the grants are intended to be used for living expenses and to make RC more accessible to those who couldn't otherwise afford to attend.

[Alumnus Greg Brockman (Summer 2 2015) shares his enthusiasm for the Recurse Center](https://blog.gregbrockman.com/recurse-center) and encourages programmers to [apply](https://www.recurse.com/apply). They can benefit from focused learning and collaborative coding.
