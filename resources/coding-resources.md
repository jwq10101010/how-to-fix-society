## In-person events and opportunities

Feel free to start up your own in-person event if there are none available near you. Below are some example(s) for inspiration:

### Recurse Center

The [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) is a self-directed educational retreat in New York City for people who want to get better at programming, RC is free for everyone. Attending a retreat at RC is a full-time commitment. You can attend for either a full batch (12 weeks) or a half-batch (six weeks). Batches meet Monday through Friday, 11 am to 5 pm ET. RC also exists online, on Zulip and in Virtual RC. Thanks to the generosity of RC's alumni community, RC offers living expense grants of up to $7,000 for all upcoming batches. Since the Recurse Center is free for everyone, the grants are intended to be used for living expenses and to make RC more accessible to those who couldn't otherwise afford to attend.

[Alumnus Greg Brockman (Summer 2 2015) shares his enthusiasm for the Recurse Center](https://blog.gregbrockman.com/recurse-center) and encourages programmers to [apply](https://www.recurse.com/apply). They can benefit from focused learning and collaborative coding.

**Project ideas**
If you're looking for project ideas, check out this compiled list: <https://github.com/the-programmers-hangout/programming-resources/blob/master/ideas.md>
If you don't like any of the ideas here and you have seriously looked through all of them, start evaluating the apps and websites you use on a daily basis. Find the flaws they have and the things you would change/add and work on your own version. Alternatively, try to come up with an idea that relates to a hobby you have.
