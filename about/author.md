Hello, world!
Below are tidbits about my personal and professional life.

**Personal life**
I enjoy EDM (Electronic Dance Music)/Pop/Rock/R&B (rhythm & blues) music, Karaoke, and amateur guitar playing (knowing some chords and strumming patterns).

**Professional life**
As of the time of this writing, I am a cloud solutions architect at an IT consultancy mainly using AWS services to help clients build out their web applications.
