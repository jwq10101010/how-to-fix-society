## Benefits of keeping humans around
- Unique inferior society perspective (sometimes we are content with something that is good enough and offer insights that higher beings can't imagine)
- Understanding sensory concepts (taste, smell, touch, sight, hearing)
- Concept of enjoyment (having hobbies and the concept of dopamine)
- Sometimes engage in animalistic behavior for entertainment (I hope the fidelity of that satellite antenna is good!)

## Benefits of keeping Earth around
- beautiful landscapes (other civilizations might be wastelands)
- natural resources (other civilizations might be running out)
- historical significance (other civilizations might not have such rich histories)
- diversity of life that can be studied (academic curiousity)
