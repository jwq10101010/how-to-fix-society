# how-to-fix-society
This repository outlines ways of improving society

## Bottom Up Approach
(start with the individual - family/community - society)
- look outside yourself to your communities (inspired by 99% perspiration talk)
  1) implement lending libraries
  2) implement green spaces
  3) facilitate discussions on certain topics
  4) create clubs to engage with people
  5) start a tour group to highlight positives of your town/city
  6) collaborate with local businesses to create unique experiences
  7) design walkable, sustainable cities; design around the people, not the transportation
  8) utilize established platforms (social media, podcasts, etc) to get feedback from the community (inspired by Adam Conover's Trans Comedians podcast episode)
- donate money, food, time, etc to those who need those resources
- set aside our differences
- work together to solve societies' problems
- produce open source software and democratize technology (it's a collective effort, we're all on the same team), also start a collaborative effort (such as what people in /r/programmingbuddies are doing)
- work towards a post-scarcity society (let's tackle the biggest problems in society together)

### Accountability and Responsibility
Some topics inspired by Andrew Tate
- Address issues of mental health and access to guns
- Parents need to parent and have a sense of honor and accountability
- No one feels attached to their environment due to generic buildings and uninspired city design
- Maintain a fit and healthy body
- People need to make an effort to change
- Hold people accountable for their actions
- Raise the next generation with good moral and ethical values

### Start your own business
- Come up with a good/product/service that your local community needs.
- Implement profit sharing

### Support local businesses
- Buy from and invest in local businesses.

## Top down approach
(from govt, corporations, and financial institutions to individuals)
Some topics inspired by Heresy Financial
- Reallocating the federal government budget to needs-based instead of age-based
- Bring the military home; if more countries are peaceful, there would be less need for military force
- Replace and/or augment the Federal Reserve (central bank) with decentralized banks
- Establish digital resources (note: not currency) for trade and commerce (inspired by Planet Nine)
  (Although in a post-scarcity society, there would be no need for a currency)
- Change the way wealth is distributed
- Revise legislation and modify tax structures on corporations and the very wealthy (instead of increasing shareholder value, focus on society best practices)

### Universal basic income (UBI)
- Inspired by Andrew Yang

### Establish cooperative businesses
- Business or organization owned by and operated for the benefit of its members
  
### Provide public utilities
- Local provider of public infrastructure including water, gas, electricity, and other natural resources
  
### The nuclear route
- scrap the current system and rebuild from the ground up

### Support Marginalized Communities

Even in the (semi-)developed world, institutionalized inequality is written in the law. One such example is discrimination based on sexual orientation. Currently, some but not all developed countries recognize same-sex couples on some level, and recently there has been growth in this area. But we still have a long way to go.
