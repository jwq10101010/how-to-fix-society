## Reasons for simulation
- Explore what happens when civilization goes down certain path (example: war games)
- Automate the boring stuff
- Explore interactions between civilizations

## Suggestions for improvement (appeal to higher authority)
- If trying to break someone out of simulation or at least to collab, wouldn't it be faster to just design and upgrade certain users instead of going through a tutorial?
- Also, look to collab with other civilizations and even attempt to collab with higher-dimension beings as well
- Focus on collaboration and better communication rather than being divided or isolated
