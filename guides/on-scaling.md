**Warning:** The following is a stream of consciousness conglomeration of concepts and potential solutions

## Upper-bound constraints
There exists an upper-bound of time, resources, things in the universe

**Ways to mitigate this**
- Appeal to higher authority (get them to help with this, maybe they can apply some parameters to limit growth like implementing natural disasters or instigating wars, or maybe dial down the birth rate) (appeal to authority option)
- Fight each other over resources (destructive option)
- Delegate managing of souls to higher authority, it's their problem now! (delegation option) - some groups champion the idea of martyrship like the Vikings and the idea of glory like the Spartans
- Figure out how to reallocate existing resources (like turning 1 excess resource to a resource that is in deficit) (reallocation option)
- Break into higher dimension and modify the parameters ourselves, overthrow the rulers/deities (anarchy option)
