**Warning:** The following is a stream of consciousness conglomeration of concepts and potential solutions

## Upper-bound constraints
There exists an upper-bound of time, resources, things in the universe

**Ways to mitigate this**
- Appeal to higher authority (get them to help with this, maybe they can apply some parameters to limit growth) (appeal to authority option)
- Fight each other over resources (destructive option)
- Delegate managing of souls to higher authority, it's their problem now! (delegation option)
- Figure out how to reallocate existing resources (like turning 1 excess resource to a resource that is in deficit) (reallocation option)
- Break into higher dimension and modify the parameters ourselves (anarchy option)
