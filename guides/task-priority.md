1) learn to delegate: this is probably the most important thing to learn; if a task is better suited for another team member, defer the task to them (that way, you have less on YOUR plate) or even better, is this task necessary?
2) Figure out if a task REALLY needs to be done ASAP (is there a hard deadline? If not, push it out to another sprint (assuming you're operating in an Agile framework)
3) identify the stakeholder(s) involved in the task: if there is leadership/upper management involved, this is a higher priority (since it might have been escalated at one point)
4) To triage the remaining tasks, you could sort it by level of difficulty, level of time effort, and of course if there's a critical element involved (like production incident)
5) Learn to rely on your team members - collaborative effort: if you see that they have less tasks assigned to them, have them be the point of contact for the task (after all, they are asking YOU for something); that way, they can do what they can and then ask you to fill in the gaps
6) And of course, if a task is very complicated to complete, apply the MVP method: what is the minimum amount required to complete the task? Then iteratively update the artifact or improve on the task
7) If you are burnt out, cover for each other (shift work mentality): take some PTO, spend some time with friends and/or family, go out for a coffee; the work is always going to be there (or maybe someone decides it's not needed anymore) but your friends and family won't always be around
8) If there are too many tasks to do and fires to put out, and not enough resources to handle the things, let the ship sink. It was doomed to fail as management did not do their job properly.
