- if we're living in a simulation, that means someone could upgrade the infrastructure to increase amount of resources
- have debt? just print more money (like how Fed Reserve operates)
- offer solutions for everyone to make more money

- if almost out of resources, figure out space travel and get more on other planets (hmm SpaceX/NASA?)
- collaborate on open source projects for software that fits your needs (also leverage existing frameworks/tools so you don't reinvent the wheel)
- use self-hosting/VPS cloud solutions for your backend infrastructure
- provide AMIs/already configured containers with all the good stuff to everyone
- provide distribution format / marketplace for the AMIs
- the secret is to mount the codebase and run watch mode inside the container, IDE devs against the machine (idk what this means)
- develop CI/CD pipeline with infra as code files
- have modular decoupled architecture (microservices) with auto-scaling groups and load balancers
- add plugin ecosystem to add functionalities
- for networking, crack the speed of light (beyond fiber optics)
- decrease latency by establishing edge locations (think CloudFront)
- enable redundacy for disaster recovery
- establish multiple ISPs/hosted zones for DNS routing?? (think Route 53)
- implement VPC technology
- honestly just read the well-architected framework docs

sorry guys im limited by time and space, use the n+1 space to collaborate and when youve reached a milestone, update the Discord group chat
