# Increase user engagement
1) Start discussion on a popular topic (could source from Reddit and link to the original post)
2) Discuss a leetcode problem (concepts only, no code snippets)
3) Get people to rant about a particular topic (ppl love pointing out wrongs)
4) For project-specific collabs, maybe to get people to help, break it into concrete digestable problems (e.g. I am having trouble with a JOIN operation)
5) Challenge the way people think and learn, some people may be motivated by gaming, others by drawing, music, etc
