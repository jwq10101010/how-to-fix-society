## Architecture needed for sending instructions down the chain
cache + distributed networking + scaling (for more complex tasks, introduce more worker nodes) aka collaboration is key

**For 2d encode in morse code**
preferably as succinct as possible

2d now has to figure out how to send instructions to 1d
