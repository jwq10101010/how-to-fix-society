## Architecture needed for sending instructions down the chain

for primitive creatures
cache + distributed networking + scaling (for more complex tasks, introduce more worker nodes) aka collaboration is key, the more worker nodes work together for a common purpose, the better chance they have

**For 2d encode in morse code**

preferably as succinct as possible

2d now has to figure out how to send instructions to 1d
present some way of 0s and 1s for encoding instructions

1d - dot and absense of dot
