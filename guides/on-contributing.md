Sometimes, people need a little push. There's so much inertia out there where people are trying to figure out how to contribute, or personal/work life takes priority (which is AOK).
There are some that may be looking for mentorship opportunities, collaborations, or hobbies but don't know how to start that up. So I figured, I would like to make the collaboration process as seamless as possible.

Of course, I'm reminded of the xkcd comic about creating a standard:

And even if there was the perfect standard for collaboration, there are also the factors of motivation and time commitment.
For the motivation piece, maybe things need to be spruced up with some lore to increase engagement.
For time commitment, there are many external factors that compete for time.

Also, the development of a curriculum/project specification is time consuming and may not pique people's interest.
So to get ideas, one can join Discord groups, or trawl through GitHub for repositories with more recent commits (indicating that it is still active).

But if nothing piques your interest, and you're still wanting to mentor people, think of a small idea that is easily doable within a couple weeks.
That way, it has relatively low time commitment, and if it fails to launch, no big deal.

Example I tried out myself was having people in a Discord group create an aggregator webpage of resources grouped by domains/programming languages with the content curated from another channel.

I was surprised when I got some bites immediately, and it felt pretty good.

All it needed was a little push to get the ball rolling.
