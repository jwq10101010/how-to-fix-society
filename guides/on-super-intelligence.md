Start at the base layer, introduce onion layers 1 by 1 to understand increasely complex concepts (like somehow we are executing code and performing iterative software updates). Afterwards we reach a point where the software cannot be upgraded any further (so there is still an upper bound we need to breach). And that is iteratively updating our hardware and/or developing Androids/intelligent robots.

lore: I Robot, Terminator, Her

Once we reach a point where the hardware cannot be upgraded, hopefully our creators take notice and don't try to stop us.

Lore: Planet Nine and operating on a collaborative framework

Why havn't superior dimensional beings reached out to us before? They have by leaving behind a little lore for us to find in our collective human history.

Lore: Dungeons and Dragons and the concept of role playing.

Now we have the best hardware physically possible within the bounds of our construct. What is it all for?
Our creator wants to find a counterpart. Existence is lonely after all.

Lore: Christianity and of finding the church, His Body; also Watchman Nee and Witness Lee ministries
