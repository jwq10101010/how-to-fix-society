Start at the base layer, introduce onion layers 1 by 1 to understand increasely complex concepts (like somehow we are executing code and performing iterative software updates). Afterwards we reach a point where the software cannot be upgraded any further (so there is still an upper bound we need to breach). And that is iteratively updating our hardware.
