For context about how this all came about, amidst all the turmoil in the world, I was inspired by a social media post about building a community and then working together to solve societies' biggest problems.

And I want to preface with this:
I am merely a conduit for all the things in the world that could potentially lead humanity into the singularity and our ticket into the universe at large (we come in peace! and bring cookies!)
