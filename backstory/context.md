## Preface
Before getting started on this journey, I will leave it up to our weary traveler to decide on the things that are real and things that are surreal.

## And away... we... go!
For context about how this all came about, amidst all the turmoil in the world, I was inspired by a social media post about building a community and then working together to solve societies' biggest problems.

And I would like to clarify my role in all this:
I am merely a conduit and aggregator of all the things in the world that could potentially lead humanity into the singularity and our ticket into the universe at large (We come in peace! And bring cookies!)

The social media post led to a voice/chat server group where a bunch of people were hanging around and weren't interacting with each other that much. Somehow, I got in contact with the server owner, and got to introducing ourselves. They explained their motivation for getting a bunch of coders together to solve the problems in the world. That message resonated with me and the server owner granted  moderator privileges to the server.

Somehow in a short time period, there were many people that joined the server, and through a whirlwind of events and a connection from a member who spanned two server groups, I came to know about Planet Nine and also about the idea of Open Source.

While in this server group, there happened to be a celebration live call of the wiki's 30th birthday. It was there that I was reminded that there is in fact a community that champions collaboration and the democratization of knowledge. And that got me to thinking, how do we get people motivated to create open source things and think about solving problems? And that became the birth of the Project Collaborative Framework and the how-to-fix-society initiative.

## But wait there's more!
Just because a standard/framework was created, it is pretty useless unless people actually use it. So one member of a Discord group I'm in is trying to establish a collaborative story platform where people can create story threads, browse story threads, and edit existing story threads to collectively create a story. After pondering for a bit, I realized that this idea already exists in the form of the Federated Wiki and other wiki platforms! After all, the original author posts a page, and someone else can fork a page to introduce new changes. If the original author approves, then the new changes are incorporated to the original, but if the author doesn't approve, the forked page still exists for others to collaborate on.
