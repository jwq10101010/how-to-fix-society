(Before getting started on this journey, I will leave it up to our weary traveler that there will be things that are real and things that are surreal.)

For context about how this all came about, amidst all the turmoil in the world, I was inspired by a social media post about building a community and then working together to solve societies' biggest problems.

And I want to preface with this:
I am merely a conduit and aggregator of all the things in the world that could potentially lead humanity into the singularity and our ticket into the universe at large (we come in peace! and bring cookies!)

The social media post lead to a voice/chat server group where a bunch of people were hanging around and weren't interacting with each other that much. Somehow, I got in contact with the server owner, and got to introducing ourselves. They explained their motivation for getting a bunch of coders together to solve the problems in the world. That message resonated with me and the server owner granted  moderator privileges to the server.

Somehow in a short time period, there were many people that joined the server, and through a whirlwind of events and a connection from a member that spanned two server groups, I came to know about Planet Nine.
