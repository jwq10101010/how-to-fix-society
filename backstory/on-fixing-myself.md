**Atomic Habits by James Clear**
<br/>
*Chapter 1*
- Make small changes daily (1% change every day)
- Change the systems/routines that form the basis of fulfilling goals
- Persevere through the routines and focus on the journey
- Manage expectations and continue along positive trajectory (positive compounding)
- Breakthrough moments can happen at any time (plateau of latent potential)
- Establish **atomic habits** which are the small repeatable 1% habits that lead to fulfilling goals/results

*Chapter 2*
- 3 layers of behavior change: identity, processes, and outcomes
- identity = beliefs, world view, self image, judgments on self and others
- processes = habits and systems
- outcomes = results/goals
- when habits become part of identity, more likely to stick to them (e.g. instead of wanting to read books, identify as a reader)
