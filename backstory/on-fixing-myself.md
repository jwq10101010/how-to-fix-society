**Atomic Habits by James Clear**
<br/>
*Chapter 1*
- Make small changes daily (1% change every day)
- Change the systems/routines that form the basis of fulfilling goals
- Persevere through the routines and focus on the journey
- Manage expectations and continue along positive trajectory (positive compounding)
- Breakthrough moments can happen at any time (plateau of latent potential)
- Establish **atomic habits** which are the small repeatable 1% habits that lead to fulfilling goals/results

*Chapter 2*
- 3 layers of behavior change: identity, processes, and outcomes
- identity = beliefs, world view, self image, judgments on self and others
- processes = habits and systems
- outcomes = results/goals
- when habits become part of identity, more likely to stick to them (e.g. instead of wanting to read books, identify as a reader)
- when habits conflict with identity, have to learn to detach from old forms of identity to become the best version of oneself
- identity = repeated beingness, embodiment of habits and actions
- values, principles, and identity should drive feedback loop of habits and identity
- focus on becoming a certain person, not on outcomes

*chapter 3*
- habits are mental shortcuts based on experience
- habits create freedom due to reduced cognitive load in doing them (brain automatically knows how to do the tasks)
- building a habit: cue, craving, response, reward
- cue triggers brain to initiate behavior that could lead to a reward
- craving is motivational force, change in state (usually positive change)
- response is actual habit performed (thought or action)
- problem phase (cue, craving)
- solution phase (response, reward)
- good habit (make it ___ )
- - cue = obvious
- - craving = attractive
- - response = easy
- - reward = satisfying
- bad habit (make it ___ )
- - cue = invisible
- - craving = unattractive
- - response = difficult
- - reward = unsatisfying
