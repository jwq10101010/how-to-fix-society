## Further lore to explore
- wiki as a sort of hive mind where one node initiates an update, and consensus is established across all other nodes (or gets forked off in order to keep track of changes, similar to how Federated Wiki works)
- when an inflection point happens, there may be some effect like losing Internet connection briefly, hearing strange humming noises, or flickering lights
- I hear there's talks of creating a hitchhiker's guide so maybe this repository could be hitchhiker's guide to project collaboration
- Have to start thinking about how to collaborate with extraterrestrials

- Move content over to a wiki community for easier collaboration
