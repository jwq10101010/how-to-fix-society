## Further lore to explore
- wiki as a sort of hive mind where one node initiates an update, and consensus is established across all other nodes (or gets forked off in order to keep track of changes, similar to how Federated Wiki works)
- I hear there's talks of creating a hitchhiker's guide so maybe this repository could be hitchhiker's guide to project collaboration
- Have to start thinking about how to collaborate with extraterrestrials

**Candidates for including in the overall Hitchhiker's Guide**

Hitchhiker's guide to democracy

Hitchhiker's guide to Python
https://docs.python-guide.org

Hitchhiker's guide - anonymous planet
https://anonymousplanet.org

## Further considerations
- Move content over to a wiki community for easier collaboration
- How to market the idea of open source communities and collaborative efforts - introduce popular culture element such as Hitchhiker's guide just like Marvel has the multiverse and all the conundrums/possibilities associated with it
