## Further lore to explore
- wiki as a sort of hive mind where one node initiates an update, and consensus is established across all other nodes (or gets forked off in order to keep track of changes, similar to how Federated Wiki works)
- I hear there's talks of creating a hitchhiker's guide so maybe this repository could be hitchhiker's guide to project collaboration
- Have to start thinking about how to collaborate with extraterrestrials
- Feeling a certain energy thrumming and pulsing around me putting me in a trance as I type the words (as if time was of the essence and the timeline needed to move more quickly)
- At certain points when committing to the repo, the internet connection would go out briefly like a large entity made a git pull
- How this large entity could traverse higher dimensions, where above time and space, you can jump between points like rewinding and fast-forwarding a video (point-in-time-and-space # or pitas #). Then beyond that, you introduce timeline # hopping between timelines. Then above that, you introduce universe # and hop between universes, above that the creator space instance (instance #) (inspired by the show Pantheon).
- Does this prove we are in a simulation?

**Candidates for including in the overall Hitchhiker's Guide**

Hitchhiker's guide to democracy

Hitchhiker's guide to Python

Hitchhiker's guide - anonymous planet

## Further considerations
- Move content over to a wiki community for easier collaboration
- How to market the idea of open source communities and collaborative efforts - introduce popular culture element such as Hitchhiker's guide just like Marvel has the multiverse and all the conundrums/possibilities associated with it
